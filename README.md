This code uses face recognition with neural network to make a password depending on shape of face for certain user. Only this user can log in and can give access to another user.
The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform. Also it is able to speak through the .Net feature of windows to welcome the user or deny another from loging in.
